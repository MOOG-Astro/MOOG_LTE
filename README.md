Installation
------------

MOOG_LTE is a Fortran 77 (F77) code.  To install the latest version of the code, employ one of the OS-specific Makefiles (Makefile.*) and 
use the following command:

    make -f Makefile*

Accordingly, a Fortran compiler is necessary (for example, succesful MOOG_LTE compilation has been achieved with the ``gfortran`` compiler).  In addition, MOOG_LTE relies 
completely upon [SuperMongo](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/sm/) for plotting/visualziation (latest release 2.4.1).	
    
Documentation
-------------
The "MOOG-LTE_Documentation_Nov2019.pdf" file is included in the distribution.  Future plans entail other forms of documentation.
